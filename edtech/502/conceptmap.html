    <h2>Addition:</h2>
    <p>Addition consists of combining two numbers to create a third. The two numbers combined are called terms or addends, while the number resulting from the combination is called the sum. Addition is represented by the symbol "+," so that the addition of "a" and "b" is represented as "a + b." Addition is commutative, meaning that the order of the operation does not matter: the operations "a + b" and "b + a" produce exactly the same result.</p>
  </section>

    <h2 class="h2blue">Subtraction:</h2>
    <p>Subtraction is used to find the difference between two numbers. The symbol "-" is used to represent subtraction, so that subtracting "b" from "a" is represented as "a - b." Unlike addition, subtraction is not commutative: the operations "a - b" and "b - a" produce very different results in most cases. If the number being subtracted, or subtrahend, is greater than the number it is being subtracted from, or minuend, the result is negative. For many students, this is their first exposure to the concept of negative numbers. </p>

    <h2>Multiplication:</h2>
    <p>Multiplication is represented by the symbol "x," so that "a" multiplied by "b" is written as "a x b." In multiplication, two numbers, called the multiplier and multiplicand, are combined to produce a third, called the product. The multiplier and multiplicand are often simply referred to as factors. Multiplication is often presented to students as repeated addition; thus, 5 x 3 can be thought of as 5 + 5 + 5. Like addition, multiplication is commutative, "a x b" being the same as "b x a." </p>

    <h2 class="h2blue">Division:</h2>
    <p>Division is in many ways the opposite of multiplication. It is represented by the symbols "/" or "รท," so that "a" divided by "b" is represented "a / b" or "a รท b." Division is the process of discovering how many times one number, the divisor, goes into another, the dividend. The result is called the quotient. Like subtraction, division is not associative: the quotients of "a / b" and "b / a" is completely different.
